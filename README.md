# PROCUREMENT BUSINESS INSIGHT DASHBOARD

This project visualizes procurement performance using transaction data from 2022 - 2023. The goal is to provide insights into supplier performance, order insight, and cost distribution using an interactive Tableau dashboard to support better procurement decision-making.

## Objective

- Monitor total procurement activity including quantity, cost, and savings
- Evaluate supplier performance based on on-time delivery (<= 15 days from order data) and average lead time
- Analyze total order by order status and item category
- Support data-driven decision making in supply chain and procurment operations

## Tools & Dataset
- Excel – Used for cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Tableau – For building the interactive dashboard
- Dataset – Procurement data collected from Kaggle

## Data Cleaning: Handling Missing Value in Delivery Dates

Problem: Some rows had missing values in the Delivery_Date column, which are critical for calculating lead time and determining on-time delivery.

Solution using Excel :
- Calculated the average lead time (in days) using rows where both Order_Date and Delivery_Date were available
- For row with missing Delivery_Date, the values were estimated by adding the average lead time to the corresponding Order_Date
- Excel Formula : (Order_Date) + (Average_Lead_Time)

## Key Insights
- Negotiation efforts have resulted in 3.9M in total savings
- MRO and Office Supplies categories have the highest procurement cost
- On-time delivery rate is 77%, suggesting room for supplier performance improvement
- Some supplier have longer average lead times (>10 days)
